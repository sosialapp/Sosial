/**
 * LinkedIn — OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + Posts API (member posts).
 *
 * SETUP (developer.linkedin.com → your app):
 * 1. Products tab → add "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect"
 *    AND "Share on LinkedIn". Both are self-serve.
 * 2. Auth tab → Authorized redirect URLs → paste the bridge URL exactly:
  *      https://sosial.app/auth.html
 *    (LinkedIn rejects custom schemes, so we bounce through the same static
 *    bridge page as Meta/TikTok/X — it forwards ?code= back to the app.)
 * 3. Put the Client ID + Client Secret in `.env` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_LI_*`).
 *
 * NOTES (read before touching):
 * 1. Same on-device-secret posture as Meta/TikTok in this app (personal MVP).
 *    Move the exchange server-side before any store release.
 * 2. Every versioned call needs BOTH headers: Linkedin-Version (YYYYMM) and
 *    X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0 — miss one and calls 400/401.
 * 3. Images are a 3-step dance per file: initializeUpload → PUT raw bytes to
 *    the uploadUrl → reference the urn:li:image:… in the post. No public host
 *    needed (unlike IG/Threads/TikTok) — bytes go direct.
 * 4. Post create returns 201 with the id in the `x-restli-id` RESPONSE HEADER,
 *    not the body (which is empty).
 * 5. Single image → content.media; 2–9 images → content.multiImage.
